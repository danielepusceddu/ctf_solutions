# HSCTF7 - got_it

### Why this was interesting
I learned about:
- Using pwntools fmtstr as a "template" to quickly create a %s leak format string. (For some reason pwntools does not have that functionality)
- Merging format strings together to do multiple things in a single go

### Flag
`flag{fl1gh7_0f_7h3_l1bc_func710n5_77e82515}`
